<p>This page was automtically generated using Github's automatic page generator, and later modified to this state.</p>
    
<p> Now getting to the purpose of this page, why would someone as insignificant as me would bother making an about page? I don't know, perhaps it's just a whim?. </p>
   
<p>Ah, too many questions, mostly about oneself, which even one doesn't know answer to.</p>

    
<p> So we will see what is the purpose of this page as we try to find answers to these so called unanswerd questions, simply because someone is curious about the nature of these questions. No, you don't have to bother reading any of this. Well then, mata ne.</p>
